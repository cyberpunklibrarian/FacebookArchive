Facebook Archive for Google Chrome

This script works in conjunction with Google Chrome to archive multiple branch pages for a library system's Facebook presence. The library I work for has something like 17 pages that need to be converted to PDF for archival purposes. The internal Save to PDF feature in Google Chrome easily facilitates this.

This script is written in AutoHotkey:
www.autohotkey.com

You can modify the URLs as needed.

To use:

1. Open Google Chrome and set the printer to be Save to PDF.

2. Close Google Chrome, the script will relaunch it when needed.

3. Create a directory for PDFs to save into. The default is C:\SocialPrint but this can be changed in the code. Create the directory before the next step.

4. Execute the script (after modifying it to your needs). Take your hands off the keyboard and let it run.

5. All files will save to the directory specified in step 3.
